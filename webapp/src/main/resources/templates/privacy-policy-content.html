    <h2 class="h5">6. Plug-ins and Tools</h2>
    <h3 class="h5">YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited („Google“), Gordon House, Barrow
        Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that YouTube does not store any
        information about visitors to this website before they watch the video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing
        of data with YouTube partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether
        you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be established. As a result,
        the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you
        visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to
        prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on your device. With the assistance
        of these cookies, YouTube will be able to obtain information about our website's visitors. Among other things, this information will
        be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site and to prevent attempts to commit
        fraud. These cookies will stay on your device until you delete them.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have started to play a YouTube video,
        which are beyond our control.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1
        lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If a corresponding agreement has been requested (e.g. an agreement to the storage of
        cookies), the processing takes place exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the agreement can be revoked at any time.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">

    <p class="text-justify">
        To ensure that fonts used on this website are uniform, this website uses so-called Web Fonts provided by Google. When you access a

        in a uniform and appealing way. According to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
